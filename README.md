bioclipse.pathvisio A plugin for bioclipse (initial one)
===================


PROJECT IDEA :Integration of WikiPathways Visualization with PathVisio into Bioclipse

Goal: To integrate PathVisio visualization widget into Bioclipse for visualization of pathway 
information from WikiPathways. Selecting protein and metabolites in the pathway visualization,
will shows of that chemical entity in other Bioclipse components, using the Jmol and JChemPaint 
plugins for Bioclipse. Preferably, interaction can be scripted, allowing integration with other 
metabolomics features in Bioclipse.

Currently plugin does : https://github.com/SravanthiSinha/bioclipse.pathvisio/blob/master/pvinbioclipse.png
