A plugin for bioclipse  (initial one)

PROJECT IDEA :Integration of WikiPathways Visualization with PathVisio into Bioclipse

Goal: To integrate PathVisio visualization widget into Bioclipse for visualization of pathway information
from WikiPathways. Selecting protein and metabolites in the pathway visualization, will shows of that chemical 
entity in other Bioclipse components, using the Jmol and JChemPaint plugins for Bioclipse. Preferably, 
interaction can be scripted, allowing integration with other metabolomics
features in Bioclipse.

Motivation: Bioclipse is a powerful platform combining a powerful scripting language to write data 
analysis and visualization workflows, which can easily be shared on, for example, MyExperiment.org [1].
While it has various components to support metabolomics in general, it lacks support for visualization 
of metabolic pathways.
